# AirportShortestPath(!NOT FINISHED!)
In this project Ä±'am trying to implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm with adjacency list representation in C programing language.
To do that, This program gets the airport network's and flight's data reading flight.txt and airports.txt files which contain the list of airports 
and the list of flight information from one airport to another one. Every flight information which is stored in the flight.txt file 
is two directionals but written only 1 time.

Example: SAW AYT 7
it means that there are 2-way flights between these airports.The integer number which comes after the airport's IATA codes represents 
the cost of flights between these airports.
